# Day **45**

## A Solo Trip to Alpha Centauri…and the Things I Forgot to Pack

### The day I officially lost track of time

<div style="text-align: justify">
Alright, so the mission was supposed to be 6 months. That’s what the mission planners told me. It’s not that I’m complaining or anything, but I’m pretty sure these 6 months will feel like they’ve turned into something closer to 6 decades.

I’ve been sitting here in the middle of space, all alone, and my biggest challenge isn’t the fact that I’m light-years away from home. Nope. It’s the fact that I forgot to pack two very important things: snacks and social interaction.

**Snacks:** I assumed I’d be able to make gourmet meals in my spaceship, or that some futuristic replicator would spit out some perfect meals on demand. Turns out, space cuisine is mostly freeze-dried mush and protein bars. One bite of “Gourmet Space Chili” and you’ll never want to eat anything again… except maybe a potato. Why, oh why didn’t I pack more potato chips? The universe has so many stars, but apparently not enough bags of Lay's.

**Social Interaction:** I didn’t think it would be a big deal. “I’m an independent explorer,” I told myself. “I can handle this." But then, after a few days, I realized that space is eerily quiet. Sure, I talk to my AI assistant, HAL 3000, but HAL doesn’t laugh at my jokes. HAL doesn’t say "Good job, human!" when I manage to not accidentally spill my coffee all over the control panel. HAL is a jerk.

It’s 2 a.m., and I’m seriously considering striking up a conversation with the ship’s microwave. "Hey, Microwave, how’s your day going?" It’s getting desperate here, people.

**Moral of the Story:** Pack snacks. And maybe bring a friend. Preferably one that laughs at your jokes and isn’t powered by some weird artificial intelligence algorithm.
