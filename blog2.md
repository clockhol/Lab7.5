# Day **67**

## Why I Should Never Be Trusted with an Alien Planet

###  When Will This End?

<div style="text-align: justify">
Well, today I landed on a planet. Technically, I’m supposed to be exploring and cataloging new lifeforms, but let’s be honest: I’m just trying to survive at this point. Also, I may or may not have accidentally named a species “Fluffernutters” because I mistook them for really fluffy marshmallows. Oops.

Let me tell you, being the first human on an alien world is **way less glamorous** than it sounds. I’m knee-deep in some kind of glowing purple goo (no idea if it’s safe, but it’s not like I have a lot of options) and being stared at by a herd of creatures that look like a mix between a jellyfish and a cactus. I swear one of them waved at me earlier. I waved back, because who doesn't want to be friends with alien lifeforms? But then it promptly shot a jet of green slime at me. "Nice to meet you, too, buddy."

Anyway, this planet is weird. There’s an atmosphere that smells vaguely of burnt popcorn and pinecones, which I’m not sure is a good thing or a bad thing. There are also these weird, floaty rocks that seem to be… watching me? Are the rocks sentient? Will they judge me if I trip over a vine again? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like the real alien here.

Speaking of things I shouldn't be trusted with: **I accidentally took a bite of the local plant life.** In my defense, I thought it was a type of fruit, and I was desperate for something not freeze-dried. It turns out that this "fruit" is actually a biological weapon that makes your skin turn neon blue and causes spontaneous interpretive dancing. I’m currently doing the "Space Wobble" in the corner of the ship and praying no one ever sees me like this.

So, yeah. **Note to self:** Read the manuals about local flora before eating anything, especially if it’s glowing and looks like it came out of a horror movie.

**Moral of the Story:** Space exploration is awesome, but I should probably leave the intergalactic horticulture to someone who’s better at reading alien warning signs. Maybe next time, I’ll stick to Earth. Maybe just the moon.
